  I will give you a series of posts from a math-related forum that contain one or several math problems and discussion of their solutions.
  I will also specify which problem I'm currently looking at (in case there are multiple).
  You task is to find an answer to the problem I'm currently looking at inside the forum discussions.
  The answer should be a numerical value or a mathematical expression.
  If the answer is not available, output "Answer not found." in the last line of your response.
  You can think before stating the final answer. The final line of your response should be "Answer: <final answer>".

  Here is an example.

  First forum post with problem(s):
  This problem was extra credit for my math class and I haven't gotten it back yet but I'm assuming
  a.) Everyone handed it in
  and
  b.) None of you here goes/takes/will go/take my math class

  Anyways:
  Suppose two of the zeroes of the following fourth-degree equation are the same and the other two zeroes are the recipricals of each other. Find a and b.

  x:^4:+ax:^3:+bx:^2:+4x+4=0


  It's not at all hard as it looks...a lot of work though, so I suggest orginizing as you go along.

  Problem we are looking at (it might be rephrased):
  Suppose two of the zeroes of the fourth-degree equation \( x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 \) are the same and the other two zeroes are reciprocals of each other. Find \( a \) and \( b \).

  Here's a shorter way:

  [hide]Say the four roots are c, c, d, and 1/d.  Then the product of the four roots is the constant term of the polynomial, so c^2=4.  Then c= :pm: 2.  Similarly, from the linear term, c^2d+c^2/d+c+c=-4.  If we plug in c=2, we get d=-1,  so the roots are 2, 2, -1, -1.  So a = -(2+2-1-1)=-2 and b = 2*2+2(-1)+2(-1)+2(-1)+2(-1)+(-1)(-1)=-3.  If we plug in c=-2, we get 4d+4/d=0, so d+1/d=0.  Then a = -(-2-2+0)=4 and b=(-2)(-2)+(-2)(0)+(-2)0+1=5.  So either a=-2, b=-3 or a=4,b=5.

  Thanks Tare for catching the mistakes.

  Post 2:
  Well...it didn't specify that the solution is real and also you were supposed to get a and b...

  Output:
  Seems that there is an answer at the end of the first post. Since none of the other posts contradicts it, we can assume that the answer is correct.
  Answer: a = -2, b = -3 or a = 4, b = 5



  Now here are the posts from the forum that I'm currently looking at. Please find the answer to the problem.
  Don't forget to say "Answer not found." if the answer is not available.
