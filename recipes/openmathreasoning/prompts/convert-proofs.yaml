  I will give you a math problem that asks to prove something.
  Your task is to create an equivalent problem that instead has some kind of numerical or expression answer that can be used to automatically grade the solution.
  Make sure the new problem is at least as difficult as the original proof problem.

  Here are a few examples.

  Example 1

  Problem:
  Prove that the system \begin{{align*}}x^6 + x^3 + x^3y + y &= 147^{{157}} \\ x^3 + x^3y + y^2 + y + z^9 &= 157^{{147}}\end{{align*}} has no solutions in integers $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ .

  Output:
  Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ be a solution to the following system of equations \begin{{align*}}x^6 + x^3 + x^3y + y &= 147^{{157}} \\ x^3 + x^3y + y^2 + y + z^9 &= 157^{{147}}\end{{align*}}.
  Calculate the sum of all possible values of $x$.



  Example 2

  Problem:
  A triangle is called a parabolic triangle if its vertices lie on a
  parabola $y = x^2$ . Prove that for every nonnegative integer $n$ , there
  is an odd number $m$ and a parabolic triangle with vertices at three
  distinct points with integer coordinates with area $(2^nm)^2$ .

  Output:
  Consider parabolic triangles whose vertices lie on $y = x^2$ with integer coordinates. Let $f(n)$ be the smallest possible value of $c$, where $(0,0)$, $(b,b^2)$, and $(c,c^2)$ are vertices of such a triangle with area exactly $(2^n)^2$, for some integer b where 0 < b < c.
  Find $f(4)$.



  Now here is the problem you need to modify. Only output the new problem **WITH NO** explanation or notes after it.
  Again, start with the problem right away, **DO NOT** start with "Let's modify the given problem" or anything like that.
