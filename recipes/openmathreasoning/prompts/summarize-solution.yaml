  I will give you a math problem and a long solution to that problem exploring different approaches, making mistakes along the way, correcting them, switching around and so on. But eventually that solution gets to the right approach and solves the problem. Your task is to write a clean version of the final correct solution without all the exploration. Cover all the details of the final solution.

  Problem:
  {problem}

  Solution:
  {generation}

  Now write a clean version of the final correct solution without all the exploration but cover all the details of the final solution.
