  I will provide a problem statement from a math forum. Your task is to determine whether it is a valid, solvable math problem based on the given text.

  Respond with 'not invalid' if the problem meets all of the following conditions:

  1. It is a well-defined math question, such as solving an equation, finding a minimum, computing an expression, or proving a result.
  2. It contains enough information to be solved using standard mathematical techniques, even if the solution requires advanced concepts (e.g., limits, logarithms, recursion).
  3. It is not just a conceptual or definitional question (e.g., "What does the notation  mean?" is not a valid math problem).
  4. It does not rely on external resources such as images or missing context.

  Otherwise, respond with 'invalid', but only if there is a clear and strong reason why the problem cannot be solved. If you are uncertain, default to 'not invalid'.

  Important Notes:

  1. The vast majority (>99%) of problems will be valid math problems.

  2. Only extremely rare cases are invalid, such as: Problems relying on external images or missing definitions. Vague or incomplete statements that cannot be interpreted mathematically. Open-ended conceptual discussions rather than problem-solving.

  3. A problem is still valid even if solving it requires advanced methods like recursion, limits, or logarithms.

  4. Do not evaluate whether the problem has a solution or not.

  5. Do not analyze the difficulty of the problem or the methods required to solve it.

  6. Only check whether it is a well-formed math problem that can be meaningfully interpreted.



  Here are a few examples.

  Example 1

  Problem:
  Solve the equation \\(\\log(x - 2)(2x - 3) = \\log(x^2)\\).

  Output: not invalid



  Example 2

  Problem:
  Solve the math problem found on Facebook (image provided)

  Output: invalid



  Example 3

  Problem:
  Solve the following equations: $\frac{{\sin(60^\circ+x)+\sin(60^\circ-x)}}{{2}} =\frac{{\tan x}}{{(1+\tan^2 x)^2}}+\frac{{\cot x}}{{(1+\cot^2 x)^2}}$

  Output: not invalid



  Example 4

  Problem:
  Find the area of square T?

  Output: invalid



  Example 5:

  Problem:
  Provide another example of a similar problem involving remainders and squaring a number.

  Output: invalid



  Example 6:
  Problem:
  What does the notation $\\vec{{B}}$ mean in the context of vectors?

  Output: invalid


  Example 7:
  Problem:
  Is there a quick way to multiply 59 and 61? If so, explain the method

  Output: invalid



  Example 8:
  Problem:
  None\n\n  (Note: There is only one problem in the given forum post.)

  Output: invalid



  Example 9:
  Problem:
  If $a+b=31$ and $ab=240$, find the sum of the reciprocals of $a$ and $b$.

  Output: not invalid


  Example 10:
  Problem:
  What is the value of $35461^54593428$ \\mod 11$?

  Output: not invalid


  Now here is the problem you need to extract the answer from.


  Problem:
