# How to reproduce our results

This section has instructions for reproducing results from
[AIMO-2 Winning Solution: Building State-of-the-Art Mathematical Reasoning Models with OpenMathReasoning dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16891)

Please note that unless you have an access to a large GPU cluster, it might take a very long time
for some of the commands to complete!
