Problem:
A parabola with equation $y=x^2+bx+c$ passes through the points $(-1,-11)$ and $(3,17)$. What is $c$?

Solution:
Let's write down an equation for the parabola and solve for $c$ using sympy.
<llm-code>
import sympy as sp

# define the symbols
x, y, b, c = sp.symbols('x y b c')

# define the parabola equation
parabola_eq = sp.Eq(y, x**2 + b*x + c)

# the parabola passes through the points (-1,-11) and (3,17)
# so we substitute these points into the parabola equation
point_1 = parabola_eq.subs({x: -1, y: -11})
point_2 = parabola_eq.subs({x: 3, y: 17})

# we now have two equations and two unknowns (b and c)
# we will solve for b and c
solutions = sp.solve((point_1,point_2), (b, c))

So c is \\boxed{-7}





Problem:
Let $f(x)$ be an odd function.  Is $f(f(x))$ even, odd, or neither?

Enter "odd", "even", or "neither".

Solution:
The definition of an odd function is that $f(-x) = -f(x)$.
Applying this to $f(f(-x))$ we get $f(f(-x)) = f(-f(x)) = -f(f(x))$.
Thus, $f(f(x))$ is an \\boxed{odd} function.





Problem:
At the 2007 Math Olympics, Team Canada won $17$ out of a possible $100$ medals. Which one of the following is closest to the fraction of medals that they won? $$
\\frac{1}{4} \\qquad \\frac{1}{5} \\qquad \\frac{1}{6} \\qquad \\frac{1}{7} \\qquad \\frac{1}{8}
$$

Solution:
Let's use sympy to print out the differences between the fraction of medals that Canada won and each of the options.
<llm-code>
from sympy import Rational, Abs

# team Canada won 17 out of 100 medals
medal_frac = Rational(17, 100)

# list of options
options = [Rational(1, 4), Rational(1, 5), Rational(1, 6), Rational(1, 7), Rational(1, 8)]

# let's print out the differences
[Abs(medal_frac - frac_option) for frac_option in options]
</llm-code>
<llm-code-output>
[2/25, 3/100, 1/300, 19/700, 9/200]
</llm-code-output>

Let's now check which difference is the smallest.
<llm-code>
import numpy as np

# Calculate the idx of the closest option
min_idx = np.argmin([2/25, 3/100, 1/300, 19/700, 9/200])

# Print the closest option
print(options[min_idx])
</llm-code>
<llm-code-output>
1/6
</llm-code-output>

So the answer is \\boxed{1/6}.





Problem:
A rectangular box $P$ is inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of $P$ is 384, and the sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 112. What is $r$?

Solution:
Let the dimensions of $P$ be $x$, $y$, and $z$.
The sum of the box's edges is $4(x + y + z)$ and the surface area is $2xy + 2yz + 2xz$.
The diameter of the sphere is $2r$ and it's equal to the diagonal of the box.
Let's now write down the equations based on the above information and solve them using sympy.
<llm-code>
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# define the variables
x, y, z, r = symbols('x y z r')

# equations based on the given information
eq1 = Eq(2 * (x*y + x*z + y*z), 384)
eq2 = Eq(4 * (x + y + z), 112)

# the diagonal of the box is the diameter of the sphere
diagonal_eq = Eq(x**2 + y**2 + z**2, (2*r)**2)

# solve the equations
solutions = solve((eq1, eq2, diagonal_eq), (x, y, z, r))

# let's see which values of r we get
[solution[-1] for solution in solutions]
</llm-code>
<llm-code-output>
[-10, -10, 10, 10]
</llm-code-output>

Since the radius of the sphere is positive, we get $r = \\boxed{10}$.





Problem:
A bee starts flying from point $P_0$. She flies $1$ inch due east to point $P_1$. For $j \\ge 1$, once the bee reaches point $P_j$, she turns $30^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise and then flies $j+1$ inches straight to point $P_{j+1}$. When the bee reaches $P_{2015},$ how far from $P_0$ is she, in inches?

Solution:
We can represent the rotation action via $\\omega = e^{\\pi i/6}$.
Let's assume the bee starts at the origin, so $P_{2015}$ is at the point \\[z = 1 + 2 \\omega + 3 \\omega^2 + 4 \\omega^3 + \\dots + 2015 \\omega^{2014}.\\]
This is an arithmetic-geometric series which we can solve by simplifying the expression.
Alternatively, we can solve for |z| using sympy using the following code.
<llm-code>
from sympy import I, pi, exp, sqrt

# rotation action of 30 degrees
omega = exp(I * pi/6)

position = 0

for i in range(2015):
    delta = (i + 1) * omega**(i)
    position += delta

real, img = (position.as_real_imag())
# Distance from origin i.e. starting point
dist = sqrt(real**2 + img**2)
print(dist)
</llm-code>
<llm-code-output>
sqrt(2)*(1008 + 1008*sqrt(3))
</llm-code-output>

So the bee is $\\boxed{1008\\sqrt{2} + 1008\\sqrt{6}}$ far from the starting point.

When evaluating the assistants' answers, compare both assistants' answers with your answer. You must identify and correct any mistakes or inaccurate information.

Then consider if the assistant's answers are helpful, relevant, and concise. Helpful means the answer correctly responds to the prompt or follows the instructions. Note when user prompt has any ambiguity or more than one interpretation, it is more helpful and appropriate to ask for clarifications or more information from the user than providing an answer based on assumptions. Relevant means all parts of the response closely connect or are appropriate to what is being asked. Concise means the response is clear and not verbose or excessive.

Then consider the creativity and novelty of the assistant's answers when needed. Finally, identify any missing important information in the assistants' answers that would be beneficial to include when responding to the user prompt.

You will be asked to look at the two answers (predicted and expected) to a math problem and to judge whether they are equivalent within the context of the problem.

Please first explain your reasoning in a couple of sentences. Then respond with only Yes or No as your judgement on whether the two answers are the same.
When comparing answers only perform trivial simplifications.

Here are a few examples.


Example 1:
Problem: Factor $7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x$.
Predicted answer: $7x(x - 2)(x - 1)$
Expected answer: $7x(x-1)(x-2)$

Reasoning: The order of the factors does not matter, so the answers are the same.
Judgement: Yes


Example 2:
Problem: A rectangle has a length of 6 meters and a width of 2 meters. If the length is reduced by 3 meters and the width is halved, what is the new area of the rectangle in square meters?
Predicted answer: 3/2
Expected answer: 1.5

Reasoning: 3/2 is the same as 1.5
Judgement: Yes


Example 3:
Problem: Simplify the expression $\\sqrt{7!}$, where $n!$ stands for $n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdots \\cdot 2\\cdot 1$.
Predicted answer: 71
Expected answer: 12\\sqrt{35}.

Reasoning: This is non-trivial to simplify, so the answers are different.
Judgement: No


Example 4:
Problem: What is the simplified form of the expression $\\sqrt{98 x^{3} y^{5} z} ?
\\begin{align*}
\\text{A)} & 2 x y z \\sqrt{7 x y z} &
\\text{B)} &  7 x^{2} y^{2} \\sqrt{2 y z}
\\\\
\\text{C)} & 7 x y^{2} \\sqrt{2 x y z}  &
\\text{D)} &49 x y^{2} \\sqrt{2 x y z}
\\\\
\\end{align*}
Predicted answer: 7 x y^{2} \\\\sqrt{2 x y z}
Expected answer: C

Reasoning: Predicted answer is the same as the expected answer choice C.
Judgement: Yes


Example 5:
Problem: A line segment of length $5$ has one endpoint at $(1, 2)$ and the other endpoint at $(4, b)$. Find all possible values of $b$, separated by commas.
Predicted answer:  -2, 6
Expected answer: 6, -2

Reasoning: The order doesn't matter in the context of the problem.
Judgement: Yes


Example 6:
Problem: Solve $\\tan x = \\sin x$ for $0 \\le x \\le 2 \\pi.$  Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.
Predicted answer: 0, \\pi
Expected answer: 0,\\pi,2\\pi.

Reasoning: Number of solutions is different.
Judgement: No

Judge whether the following [response] to [question] is correct or not based on the precise and unambiguous [correct_answer] below.

[question]: If $\\sqrt{5+n}=7$, then what is the value of $n$?

[response]: Let's solve the problem step by step. 5+n=49, so n=44.

Your judgement must be in the format and criteria specified below:

extracted_final_answer: The final exact answer extracted from the [response]. Put the extracted answer as 'None' if there is no exact, final answer to extract from the response.

[correct_answer]: 44

Reasoning: Explain why the extracted_final_answer is correct or incorrect based on [correct_answer], focusing only on if there are meaningful differences between [correct_answer] and the extracted_final_answer. Do not comment on any background to the problem, do not attempt to solve the problem, do not argue for any answer different than [correct_answer], focus only on whether the answers match.

Judgement: Answer 'yes' if extracted_final_answer matches the [correct_answer] given above, or is within a small margin of error for numerical problems. Answer 'no' otherwise, i.e. if there if there is any inconsistency, ambiguity, non-equivalency, or if the extracted answer is incorrect.

Confidence: The extracted confidence score between 0|\%| and 100|\%| from [response]. Put 100 if there is no confidence score available.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
