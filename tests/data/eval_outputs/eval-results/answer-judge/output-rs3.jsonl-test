{"judgement": "To determine if the predicted and expected answers are equivalent, let's analyze them step by step.\n\nThe given problem states:\n- A parabola with equation \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) has a vertical line of symmetry at \\( x = 1 \\).\n- The parabola passes through the points \\((-1, 3)\\) and \\((2, -2)\\).\n- The quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) has two real roots.\n- The greater root is \\( \\sqrt{n} + 1 \\).\n\nFirst, since the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at \\( x = 1 \\), the axis of symmetry is \\( x = 1 \\). This implies that the vertex form of the parabola can be written as:\n\\[ y = a(x-1)^2 + k \\]\n\nNext, we use the fact that the parabola passes through the point \\((-1, 3)\\). Substituting these coordinates into the equation:\n\\[ 3 = a(-1-1)^2 + k \\]\n\\[ 3 = 4a + k \\]\n\\[ k = 3 - 4a \\]\n\nNow, the parabola also passes through the point \\((2, -2)\\). Substituting these coordinates into the equation:\n\\[ -2 = a(2-1)^2 + k \\]\n\\[ -2 = a + k \\]\n\\[ -2 = a + (3 - 4a) \\]\n\\[ -2 = 3 - 3a \\]\n\\[ 3a = 5 \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( a = \\frac{5}{3} \\) back into the expression for \\( k \\):\n\\[ k = 3 - 4 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\]\n\\[ k = 3 - \\frac{20}{3} \\]\n\\[ k = \\frac{9}{3} - \\frac{20}{3} \\]\n\\[ k = -\\frac{11}{3} \\]\n\nThus, the equation of the parabola is:\n\\[ y = \\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2 - \\frac{11}{3} \\]\n\nExpand this to standard form:\n\\[ y = \\frac{5}{3}(x^2 - 2x + 1) - \\frac{11}{3} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{5}{3}x^2 - \\frac{10}{3}x + \\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{11}{3} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{5}{3}x^2 - \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{6}{3} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{5}{3}x^2 - \\frac{10}{3}x - 2 \\]\n\nWe need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \\( \\frac{5}{3}x^2 - \\frac{10}{3}x - 2 = 0 \\).
