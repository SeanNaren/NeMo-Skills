We realize that the sawtooth graph is just a bunch of lines where the positive slope lines are  $y = x, y = x + 4, y = x + 8,...$ . The intersections of these lines, along with the parabola are just solving the system of equations:  $x = 34y^2$  and  $y = x, y = x + 4, ...$ . If we just take  $y = x$  and  $x = 34y^2$ , we see that the sum of all  $y$  by Vieta's is just  $\\frac{1}{34}$ . Similarly, for  $y = x + 4$ , the sum of the roots by Vieta's is also  $\\frac{1}{34}$ . So for all the positive slope lines intersecting with the parabola just gives the sum of all  $y$  to continuously be  $\\frac{1}{34}$ . Okay, now let's look at the negative slope lines. These will have equations of  $y = 2 - x, y = 6 - x, y = 10 - x, ..., y = 34 - x, ...$ . Similar to what we did above, we just set each of these equations along with the parabola  $x = 34y^2$ . The sum of all  $y$  for each of these negative line intersections by Vieta's is  $\\frac{-1}{34}$ . This keeps going for all of the lines until we reach  $y = 34 - x$ . Now, unfortunately, both solutions don't work as the negative solution is out of the range of [1 , 3], [5, 7] and so on. So we just need to take one solution for this and that being the positive one according to the graph. So we just need to solve  $34 - y = 34y^2$  which means  $34y^2 + y - 34 = 0$ . Solving gives \\[y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{68^2 + 1}}{68} = \\frac{-1 + 5 \\sqrt{185}}{68}.\\] So, the sums of the roots are  $\\frac{1}{34}$  +  $\\frac{-1}{34}$  +  $\\frac{1}{34}$  + .... +  $\\frac{-1}{34}$  +  $\\frac{1}{34}$  +  $\\frac{-1 + 5 \\sqrt{185}}{68}.$  Nicely all the  $\\frac{1}{34}$  terms cancel out leaving with only one  $\\frac{1}{34}$  and  $\\frac{-1 + 5 \\sqrt{185}}{68}.$  So the sum of these two is  $\\frac{1 + 5 \\sqrt{185}}{68}.$  From there, the answer is  $\\boxed{259}$ ."}

Let  $X$  be the Fermat point of  $\\triangle ACD$ , with motivation stemming from considering the pentagon as  $\\triangle ACD$  with the two 30-60-90 extensions. Note that  $AX+CX+DX$  is minimized at this point when  $\\angle AXC=\\angle CXD=\\angle AXD=120^{\\circ}$ . Because we have  $\\angle ABC=\\angle AED=60^{\\circ}$ , then  $ABCX$  and  $AXDE$  are both cyclic. Then we have  $\\angle AXE=\\angle ADE=90^{\\circ}$  and  $\\angle BXA=\\angle BCA=90^{\\circ}$ . Then it turns out that we actually have  $\\angle BXE=90^{\\circ}+90^{\\circ}=180^{\\circ}$ , implying that  $B$ ,  $X$  and  $E$  are collinear. Now, by the triangle inequality, we must have  $BX+XE\\geq BE$ , with equality occurring when  $X$  is on  $BE$ . Thus  $AX+CX+DX$  and  $BX+EX$  are minimized, so this point  $X$  is our desired point. Firstly, we will find  $BX+EX=BE$ . We have that  $AC=7\\sqrt{3}$  and  $AD=13\\sqrt{3}$ , so applying the Law of Cosines in  $\\triangle ACD$ , we get  \\[147+507-2(7\\sqrt{3})(13\\sqrt{3})\\cos (\\angle CAD)=576\\implies \\cos(\\angle CAD)=\\frac{1}{7}.\\]  It follows as a result that  $\\sin (\\angle CAD)=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{7}$ . Then we want to find  $\\cos (\\angle BAE)$ .

Now, we will find the value of  $AX+CX+DX$ . Construct a point  $P$  outside such that  $\\triangle CPD$  is equilateral, as shown. By property of fermat point, then  $A$ ,  $X$ , and  $P$  are collinear. Additionally,  $\\angle CXD=120^{\\circ}$ , so  $CPDX$  is cyclic. Applying Ptolemy's Theorem, we have that  $(CX)(PD)+(CP)(XD)=(XP)(CD)$ . But since  $\\triangle CPD$  is equilateral, it follows that  $CX+DX=PX$ . Then  $AX+CX+DX=AX+PX=AP$ , so we wish to find  $AP$ . Applying the Law of Cosines in  $\\triangle ACD$ , we have that  \\[(13\\sqrt{3})^2+24^2-2(13\\sqrt{3})(24)\\cos (\\angle ADC)=(7\\sqrt{3})^2\\implies \\cos (\\angle ADC)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\implies \\angle ADC=30^{\\circ}.\\]  Then because  $\\angle CDP=60^{\\circ}$ , then  $\\angle ADP=90^{\\circ}$ , so we can find  $AP$  simply with the Pythagorean Theorem. We know  $AD=13\\sqrt{3}$  and  $DP=CD=24$ , so  $AP=\\sqrt{(13\\sqrt{3})^2+24^2}=19\\sqrt{3}$ . We then have  $f(X)=AX+BX+CX+DX+EX=(BX+EX)+(AX+CX+DX)=BE+AP=38+19\\sqrt{3}$ , which is our minimum value. Therefore, the answer to the problem is  $38+19+3=\\boxed{060}$ ."}

However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.

This is accomplished by finding the intersection of two lines:  \\[     a(-\\sqrt{3}x +\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) + x\\sqrt{1-a^2} = a\\sqrt{1-a^2} \\] Where we have also used the fact that  $b=\\sqrt{1-a^2}$ , which follows nicely from  $a^2+b^2 =1$ .   \\[     a(-\\sqrt{3}x +\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})   = (a-x)\\sqrt{1-a^2} \\] Square both sides and go through some algebraic manipulations to arrive at \n \\[     -a^4 +2xa^3+(-4x^2+3x+\\frac{1}{4})a^2-2xa+x^2=0 \\] Note how  $a=\\frac{1}{2}$  is a solution to this polynomial, and it is logically so. If we found the set of intersections consisting of line segment  $\\overline{AB}$  with an identical copy of itself, every single point on the line (all  $x$  values) should satisfy the equation. Thus, we can perform polynomial division to eliminate the extraneous solution  $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ .  \\[     -a^3 + (2x-\\frac{1}{2})a^2+(-4x^2+4x)a-2x^2=0 \\] Remember our original goal. It was to find an  $x$  value such that  $a=\\frac{1}{2}$  is the only valid solution. Therefore, we can actually plug in  $a=\\frac{1}{2}$  back into the equation to look for values of  $x$  such that the relation is satisfied, then eliminate undesirable answers.\n \\[     16x^2-10x+1=0 \\] \nThis is easily factored, allowing us to determine that  $x=\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{1}{2}$ . The latter root is not our answer, since on line  $\\overline{AB}$ ,  $y(\\frac{1}{2})=0$ , the horizontal line segment running from  $(0,0)$  to  $(1,0)$  covers that point. From this, we see that  $x=\\frac{1}{8}$  is the only possible candidate. Going back to line  $\\overline{AB}, y= -\\sqrt{3}x+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ , plugging in  $x=\\frac{1}{8}$  yields  $y=\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}$ . The distance from the origin is then given by  $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{8^2}+(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8})^2} =\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{16}}$ . That number squared is  $\\frac{7}{16}$ , so the answer is  $\\boxed{023}$ . <br/> ~Installhelp_hex", "expected_answer": "23", "source": "aime24"}

If there are  $5$ , no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are  $1$ ,  $3$ , or  $4$  coins left. Bob wins if there are  $2$  or  $5$  coins left. After some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is n is a multiple of  $5$ , then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of  $5$  coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes  $1$ , Bob will take  $4$ , and there will still be a multiple of  $5$ . If Alice takes  $4$ , Bob will take  $1$ , and there will still be a multiple of  $5$ . This process will continue until you get  $0$  coins left. For example, let's say there are  $205$  coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of  $5$  left. This will continue until there are  $5$  coins left, and Bob will end up winning. After some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to  $2$  mod  $5$  will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are  $2$  coins left, Alice is forced to take  $1$  and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are  $72$  coins.

In our case,  $A$  represents the probability of winning the grand prize, and  $B$  represents the probability of winning a prize. Clearly,  $P(B|A)=1$ , since by winning the grand prize you automatically win a prize. Thus, we want to find  $\\dfrac{P(A)}{P(B)}$ . Let us calculate the probability of winning a prize. We do this through casework: how many of Jen's drawn numbers match the lottery's drawn numbers? To win a prize, Jen must draw at least  $2$  numbers identical to the lottery. Thus, our cases are drawing  $2$ ,  $3$ , or  $4$  numbers identical. Let us first calculate the number of ways to draw exactly  $2$  identical numbers to the lottery. Let Jen choose the numbers  $a$ ,  $b$ ,  $c$ , and  $d$ ; we have  $\\dbinom42$  ways to choose which  $2$  of these  $4$  numbers are identical to the lottery. We have now determined  $2$  of the  $4$  numbers drawn in the lottery; since the other  $2$  numbers Jen chose can not be chosen by the lottery, the lottery now has  $10-2-2=6$  numbers to choose the last  $2$  numbers from. Thus, this case is  $\\dbinom62$ , so this case yields  $\\dbinom42\\dbinom62=6\\cdot15=90$  possibilities. Next, let us calculate the number of ways to draw exactly  $3$  identical numbers to the lottery. Again, let Jen choose  $a$ ,  $b$ ,  $c$ , and  $d$ . This time, we have  $\\dbinom43$  ways to choose the identical numbers and again  $6$  numbers left for the lottery to choose from; however, since  $3$  of the lottery's numbers have already been determined, the lottery only needs to choose  $1$  more number, so this is  $\\dbinom61$ . This case yields  $\\dbinom43\\dbinom61=4\\cdot6=24$ . Finally, let us calculate the number of ways to all  $4$  numbers matching. There is actually just one way for this to happen. In total, we have  $90+24+1=115$  ways to win a prize. The lottery has  $\\dbinom{10}4=210$  possible combinations to draw, so the probability of winning a prize is  $\\dfrac{115}{210}$ . There is actually no need to simplify it or even evaluate  $\\dbinom{10}4$  or actually even know that it has to be  $\\dbinom{10}4$ ; it suffices to call it  $a$  or some other variable, as it will cancel out later.

Note that the probability of winning a grand prize is just matching all  $4$  numbers, which we already calculated to have  $1$  possibility and thus have probability  $\\dfrac1{210}$ .

We're given that the volume is  $23$ ; thus,  $a^2L=23$ . We're also given that the surface area is  $54=2\\cdot27$ ; thus,  $a^2+2aL=27$ . From the first equation, we can get  $L=\\dfrac{23}{a^2}$ .
